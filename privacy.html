    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025</p>

    <p>
      Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains, in simple language, what information
      is handled by <strong>AllFile Pro</strong> and how it is used.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What information we handle</h2>
    <p>AllFile Pro is a local reading and document-organizing app. It may handle:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documents you import into the app (for example PDFs, ebooks and text files).</li>
      <li>Reading metadata such as last opened time, reading progress, favorites and statistics.</li>
      <li>Basic device information required to render pages correctly (such as screen size and orientation).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your documents are stored on your own device or in the cloud providers you choose to connect.
      AllFile Pro does <strong>not</strong> upload your library to our own servers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Cloud and third‑party services</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose to import files from cloud providers (for example Google Drive or similar
      services), those providers may process your data according to their own terms and privacy
      policies. AllFile Pro only requests the access needed to list and download the documents you
      select inside the app.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>Within the app, information is used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show and organize your documents in your library.</li>
      <li>Remember your reading position, favorites and recently opened files.</li>
      <li>Provide reading statistics and improve the in‑app reading experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data retention and control</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Documents remain under your control. You can delete them from within the app or from your device storage.</li>
      <li>Reading statistics and settings are stored on your device (and may be included in your device backups, if enabled).</li>
      <li>You can clear app data at any time from your device’s system settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on the security features of your device and operating system. While we take reasonable
      steps to protect your data inside the app, no application can guarantee perfect security.
      Please keep your device locked, protected with a passcode or biometrics, and up to date.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can stop using AllFile Pro at any time and remove it from your device.</li>
      <li>You can delete individual documents or clear app data from your system settings.</li>
      <li>You can choose whether or not to connect any cloud providers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will
      always show the current version. Continued use of the app after any changes means you accept
      the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please use the contact details provided in
      the app store listing or inside the Help section of the app. Including screenshots and a short
      description of the issue helps us respond more effectively.
